# smartyads test by otalanov

#### Run the app with ng serve

#### My apologies for unfinishing this task. 
I had to be really quick, with almost no time for this test. But I tried to show up main skills and qualifications in terms of my time limitations.
Please, see the list of unimplemented features below:
1) Normal data interaction via JSON is available on the auction chart only. 
2) Dragging and resizing is not implemented. 
3) Countries and New Users cards are not implemented
4) UI realisation is as simple as possible

I hope that you treat this with understanding. I had no time to deliver something more valuable. Hope we can talk about this in detail one day.

#### For charts I used the following library: http://www.chartjs.org/
#### UI -> https://material.angular.io/
